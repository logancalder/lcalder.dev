                <li class = "content">In <strong class = "light">February of 2023</strong>, I was invited to compete at <strong class = "red">Treehacks</strong>, <strong class = "red">Stanford</strong>'s annual Hackathon.
                Along with a team of <strong class = "light">3 others</strong>, with two of us attending our first Hackathon, we created a <strong class = "light">smart AI shopping assistant</strong> utilizing 
                    <strong class = "red">OpenAI</strong>'s JavaScript API.</li>
                <li class = "content">My contribution to the project was a <strong class = "red">user-friendly UI</strong> which the user could converse with the bot. I also 
                    created a sales presentation which we used to pitch our product to judges, includes representatives from <strong class = "light">OpenAI</strong>, <strong class = "light">Google
                    </strong>, and <strong class = "light">repl.it</strong>.</li>
                <li class = "content">While the finalized product is not available, you may view my work here <strong class = "red"><a href = "https://github.com/logancalder/Treehacks-2023.git" target = "_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github" id = "red"></i></a></strong></li>

                <li class = "content">My personal contribution to the project was entirely <strong class = "light">frontend</strong>, being a <strong class = "red">user-friendly chatbox</strong> to give OpenAI's API prompts and recieve responses.
                    The purpose of this work was to make asking questions as <strong class = "light">simple and straight-forward</strong> as possible for the customer.
                </li>
                <li class = "content">My work features a <strong class = "light">button</strong> that appears in the bottom right of the client's screen. When clicked on, a <strong class = "red">retractable chatbox</strong> expands to fill 
                    the right half of the screen. Here, the user may ask <strong class = "light">any question</strong> regarding a product on the website.
                </li>
                <li class = "content">Any question that is "undefined" or an empty string will not cause the AI to respond. Only when a <strong class = "light">valid input</strong> is provided, the AI will respond,
                    creating a <strong class = "red">new reponse textbox</strong> with a respective profile picture. Messages may be sent with the <strong class = "light">send button</strong>, and the chatbox may be closed with the <strong class = "light">close button</strong>.

                <li class = "content">Prior to the event, I had <strong class = "red">no team or knowledge</strong> of what a <strong class = "light">Hackathon</strong> would be like. I was very <strong class = "light">excited</strong>, but admittedly nervous.</li>
                <li class = "content">Around two weeks before the start date, I began reaching out to fellow hackers. Together, we managed to form a <strong class = "light">team of 4</strong> from across
                    the country, with none of us having met before. It also happened to be one of my <strong class = "light">fellow teammates first Hackathon</strong> as well!
                </li>
                <li class = "content">We went through many ideas and subjects of which to code, but finally settled on a <strong class = "red">Smart AI</strong> that could effectively <strong class = "light">eliminate the need
                    for customer support</strong>. The program would utilize <strong class = "red">OpenAI's API</strong>, and would have its own website to demonstrate both the <strong class = "light">administrative and customer experience</strong>.
                </li>
                <li class = "content">With Treehacks being <strong class = "red">36 hours</strong>, we set to work right away. One of my teammates, <strong class = "light">Adi</strong>, focused on the <strong class = "red">backend features</strong> and figured out how to
                    train OpenAI's API with custom data. He then focused on how to <strong class = "light">permit the AI to provide for that data</strong>.
                </li>
                <li class = "content">My other two teammates, <strong class = "light">Alyssa</strong> and <strong class = "light">Sabrina</strong>, focused on creating the <strong class = "red">frontend homepage</strong> of the website, with a <strong class = "light">navigation bar</strong> and <strong class ="light">displayable
                    product lists</strong>.
                </li>
                <li class = "content">As I mentioned earlier, I focused on creating the <strong class = "red">actual interface</strong> that the user could <strong class = "light">discuss with the bot inside of</strong>. Fortunately, after over
                <li class = "content">20 hours of straight coding---and much testing---our <strong class = "light">program came to life</strong> after linking our code.

                    respective information about price, categories, and even answering educative questions such as, <strong class = "light">"What is the best fruit to give to my child?</strong>"

                    on the new data provided and be able to <strong class = "light">provide educated answers</strong> to questions regarding it.

                minds in the tech industry. Not only did I meet some <strong class = "light">really bright students and form great new connections</strong>, but I was able to attend some really interesting
                and informative lectures provided by <strong class = "red">tech giants</strong> and <strong class = "red">startups</strong>.
            </li>
            <li class = "content">At the event, I met representatives from notable companies like <strong class = "red">OpenAI, Google, repl.it,</strong> and <strong class = "red">Y Combinator</strong>. They all provided me with great feedback
                and suggestions for how to start my career. <strong class = "light">Y Combinator even encouraged my group to contact them if we felt our product to be solid enough to launch!</strong>
            </li>
            <li class = "content">While I came out of this project <strong class = "light">extremely sleep deprived</strong>, I am extremely proud of myself for attending and creating a product that I can be
                proud of. Not to mention the pride behind <strong class = "light">presenting our AI to tech giants and seeing them smile</strong>; certainly one of the best feelings.
