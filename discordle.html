                <li class = "content">This project began back in <strong class = "light">February</strong> when I first played Wordle, which was just gaining popularity at the time. After playing the game, I thought to myself, "this can't be that hard to code." 
                    Alas, it was <strong class = "light">not as easy</strong> as I expected.</li>
                <li class = "content">I set to work on this project shortly after, and began thinking of ways to recreate the game. I eventually settled on converting a <strong class = "light">5 letter string to a list</strong>, and looping through it to test for letter positions. From there,
                    I would simply assign an empty list an emoji varying in color, depending on if the user's guessed letter was in the right position. That list would then simply be <strong class = "red">printed in an embed</strong>, and displayed to the user.</li>
                <li class = "content">While this project does work fairly well, it <strong class = "light">does have its drawbacks</strong>. For starters, the user's guesses <span class = "comment">/* Up to all 6 of them */</span> may be viewed in the chat in which they are guessing. So, while the 
                original guess is removed, all previous ones and their letter locations <strong class = "light">may be viewed</strong>. If I were to revisit this project, I would most likely change the bot to work in <strong class = "red">private messaging</strong> rather than in public chats. This is a decently simple solution to do,
            but since my project only ended up getting used by a few of my friends, I was <strong class = "light">content with how it worked</strong> for now.</li>
