# Website

This collection of HTML and CSS is a website that I set to make beginning 9.4.22. I wanted to create a place in which I could share my projects to the world, while also making it a project in itself.

As an aspiring Software Engineer, I wanted to put my skills to the test learning two new forms of code, and see just how professional of a website I could create.

The website contains multiple pages, animations, and interactive parts to make the user experience more enjoyable and the website fun to explore. In a way, I wanted to bring my CV some life, rather than it being a dull piece of paper.

I was heavily inspired to make this website by Iuri, a Senior Frontend Developer. His website is linked here:
